# HelloID-Conn-Prov-Target-NedapOns-Weekkaart

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository contains the connector and configuration code only. The implementer is responsible to acquire the connection details such as username, password, certificate, etc. You might even need to sign a contract or agreement with the supplier before implementing this connector. Please contact the client's application manager to coordinate the connector requirements.

> [!NOTE]
> This connector has limited support for Nedap employees. Please refer to the [Fact Sheet](#fact-sheet) for more details.
>
> __Extensive knowledge of HelloID Provisioning and Nedap Ons (both Nedap user and Nedap employee) is required.__

> [!IMPORTANT]
>  **Upgrade Warning**
> Since the November 14, 2024 update, the connector has transitioned from using a single mapping file to **three separate files**.
> If a customer prefers not to use the new structure, they can continue using the previous `NedapEmployeeMapping.csv` file by referencing the **same file three times** in the configurationâ€”once for each mapping.

## Introduction
This repository only contains the documention. The source code can be found in a private repository and is only meant for internal use.

Nedap Ons provides an API and XML import method to programmatically interact with its services and data. This connector only updates the _registration profile_.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **Nedap PFX Certificate** <br>
  A valid Nedap certificate (.PFX) *Tools4ever need to requests a certificate by Nedap to access the REST API*

- **Credentials IOImport**<br>
  Credentials for the IO Import *Different account credentials as the REST API*

- **Mapping Files**<br>
  Mapping between HR departments / functions and the registration profile.

- **Custom HelloId Property**<br>
  A custom property on the HelloID Person contract with a combination of the employeeCode and EmploymentCode called __custom.NedapOnsIdentificationNo__

### Field mapping

The field mapping can be imported using the `_fieldMapping.json` file.

In addition to the field mapping, some properties require extra mappings that are not included in the file. These properties are added directly in the code:
- `MutationAction`
- `Contract`
- `RegistrationProfile`


#### The Primary Contract Calculation foreach employment
The primary contract calculation is the same as the HelloID primary contract calculation. Note that the order of properties can be adjusted to meet the customer's requirements.

```Powershell
## Configuration
# Primary Contract Calculation foreach employment
$firstProperty =  @{ Expression = { $_.Details.Fte };             Descending = $true  }
$secondProperty = @{ Expression = { $_.Details.HoursPerWeek };    Descending = $true  }
$thirdProperty =  @{ Expression = { $_.Details.Sequence };        Descending = $true  }
$fourthProperty = @{ Expression = { $_.EndDate };                 Descending = $true  }
$fifthProperty =  @{ Expression = { $_.StartDate };               Descending = $false }
$sixthProperty =  @{ Expression = { $_.ExternalId };              Descending = $false }

# Priority Calculation Order (High priority -> Low priority)
$splatSortObject = @{
    Property = @(
        $firstProperty,
        $secondProperty,
        $thirdProperty,
        $fourthProperty,
        $fifthProperty,
        $sixthProperty)
}
```

#### Script Mapping lookup values
```Powershell
# Lookup value which is used in the mapping to determine the education, registration profile, and optionally the Cluster(Team)
$eduRegTeamPrimaryLookupKey   = { $_.Title.ExternalId }      # Mandatory
$eduRegTeamSecondaryLookupKey = { $_.Department.ExternalId } # Not Mandatory
```

#### Cluster Configuration
```Powershell
# Determine if the cluster requires a CSV mapping or has a one-to-one relationship with the HelloID configuration.
if (-not ($actionContext.Configuration.skipCsvMappingForCluster -eq $true)) {
    $clusterId = { $_.Department.ExternalId }
    $clusterName = { $_.Department.DisplayName }
}
```

## Remarks

### Correlation

Because Nedap contains multiple accounts per HelloID person (contract), accounts are correlated based on a custom contract property called `custom.NedapOnsIdentificationNo`. An example of this can be found in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section. This approach is necessary because HelloID does not support correlation based on contract properties.

Although the standard person correlation configuration in HelloID cannot be used directly, **connector-level correlation must be enabled**. Without it, the update trigger will be lost when an account is correlated, and the correlated accounts will not be immediately updated after correlation.

### Primary Contract

Since the connector supports multiple accounts for a single HelloID person (per contract), the default primary contract calculation may not always be applicable. The connector includes an example of a primary contract calculation that determines the primary contract for each employment in Nedap.

### IO Import validation

When updating an employee account, it's not possible to directly verify whether the _registration profile_ has been successfully updated in Nedap. To confirm this, you need to check the_ Import Report_ in the Nedap UI by going to: _Beheer > Import > Importrapportage inzien._

### OutputInfo

In the field mapping, some properties have a `_outputInfo` prefix. These properties are **only** used to return data from the connector, and the information is visible in the account data or in the notification. Since there can be multiple accounts, the connector returns the values as comma-separated strings. Note that there is **no link** between the individual values.

## Employee Additional Mapping:

| Header                       | Description                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary Contract calculation | Example of a Primary contract calculation.              |
| Title.ExternalId             | Property of the HelloID primary contract per employment |
| Department.ExternalId        | Property of the HelloID primary contract per employment |
| RegistrationProfile          | Weekkaartprofiel > ProfileName                          |

> [!TIP]
> That the mapped value will be created if they do not exist in Nedap! So if you choose a RegistrationProfile that does not exist, it will be created. What might encounter some unexpected behavior.*
